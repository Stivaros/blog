## In Summary (tl;dr)

_In a rush? Lazy? This section explains the scores in a nutshell_

**1/5:** Significant underperformance - cost of remediation is prohibitive, look to replace

**2/5:** Slight underperformance - managers should focus here,  turn 2s into 3s for greatest return

**3/5:** Good - performing as expected

**4/5:** Excellent - overperforming, driving at the "project" level

**5/5:** Outstanding - pushing the entire company forward, train against this standard

## Introduction

This system is based on experience across my career managing people, projects and/or systems in both technical and non-technical roles.

It's been 'in development' for years but I've finally settled upon something I feel happy sharing. Nothing is perfect, or beyond constructive feedback, and I would love to hear the thoughts of others on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/eStivaros) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/estivaros).

## What is this system for?

Reviewing performance, preferably of direct reports, on a five-point scale.

## Preface

If you are the sort of person that defaults to 7/10 rather than 5/10, you will probably hate this. I hate that you make seven the midpoint of a ten point scale and this is my blog, so deal with it.

## Review System

### Before Reviewing / Setting Objectives

People need to know what they're being assessed against. Projects and systems don't, but setting expectations ahead of time prevents bias after the fact. Therefore, we must start by explaining the behaviours and outcomes we want to see.

* Set high standards
* Ensure the standards are understood
* Confirm acceptance/buy-in of the standards
* At every opportunity, model those standards
* Highlight those standards often

Essentially, set a high bar and then constantly refer back to it. Use your current outstanding people and systems/projects as benchmarks. Encourage innovation - the current outstanding performance should be beaten by the next period's outstanding performance. If someone new joins your team, any member of the team should be able to able to explain the standards to them, such should be their level of familiarity.

### The Five-Point Scale

#### 1/5 (Significant underperformance)

Falling well below expectation on **any** metric. Consider terminating employees performing to this standard. Projects going this badly should be dropped immediately, where possible.

Things can be recovered from this stage but, in my experience, the effort likely won't be worth it.

Markers for this score:

* Little to no output
  * People are lost
  * Systems/projects have stalled or progress very slowly
* Low quality
  * People are producing work that has to be reworked or is barely presentable
  * Systems/projects are outdated by the time they're put into action
* Morale
  * People are toxic, actively spreading poor morale to others
  * Systems/projects are sapping energy and causing resignations

#### 2/5 (Slight underperformance)

Things are going relatively well but objectives aren't quite being met.
These are the best people and projects to invest time into as they can become strong performers with a little nudge in the right direction.

Given the high standards that should be set in advance, this is not a bad score.

Markers for this score:

* Almost meeting expected output
  * People, systems and projects are completing 85%+ of their workload
* Acceptable quality
  * People need someone trusted to give their work a once-over (in technical teams I strongly believe all code should be reviewed, in this case someone more seniorshould be doing the reviewing)
  * Systems/projects are functional but some flaws are known and worked-around
* Morale
  * People are OK in most circumstances
  * Systems/projects are workable but there are common complaints and hesitance to use

#### 3/5 (Good)

Achieving the high standards that have been set. This is no small feat - 3/5 is a praise-worthy score in this system!
It means that everything is operating as it should and the review should be positive, perhaps even celebratory.

Markers for this score:

* Achieving expected output against deadlines
  * People are completing all work assigned to them in the agreed timescales and can onboard new joiners
  * Systems/projects are progressing or as productive as expected
* High quality
  * People are producing work that is agreeable without major redrafting
  * Systems/projects 'just work' (NB: this is actually quite an achievement)
* Morale
  * People fit into the team well and are respected
  * Systems/projects don't warrant any major criticism, nor are they particularly enjoyed

#### 4/5 (Excellent)

Things are going better than planned and/or this is a star performer on a project-basis. Objectives are being achieved and behaviours are worth modelling across the team.

Naturally, there will be a maximum of two/three people attaining this level per project.

Markers for this score:

* Output is better than expected
  * People are either completing work early or shipping more than expected within deadlines, they guide the project
  * Systems/projects are ahead of schedule or under budget
* High quality
  * People are achieving the above without cutting corners
  * Systems/projects have a reputation for being robust and fully-functional
* Morale
  * People are role models within their project team
  * Systems/projects are a pleasure to work within/on

#### 5/5 (Outstanding)

The star of the show. Irrespective of the scope of the person or project/system, it is driving the entire company forward. Everything is being achieved ahead of time and/or with greater value than planned. Within the company, this is the point of reference for strong performance.

Naturally, there will be a maximum of one/two people attaining this level within their discipline across a company or division (depending on size).

Markers for this score:

* Output is better than expected on a consistent basis
  * People are producing the highest-value work across the entire company, setting higher standards
  * Systems/projects are running smooth and efficient to a level unseen before
* Company-leading quality
  * People are the ones defining the company's greatest ability
  * Systems/projects set the tone for future expectations
* Morale
  * People are role models for the entire company, working with them is exciting
  * Systems/projects are respected - working on them is a privilege
