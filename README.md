# Blog

This is my personal blog from the [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) template.
Instructions and inspiration from [Dave Ceddia's blog](https://daveceddia.com/start-blog-gatsby-netlify/).

No installation or usage instructions as I'm the only one running this. Feel free to fork and play around.
Ideally, use the blog post above to get yourself up and running!

## Create a new post

ChatGPT helped (read: did **all of the heavy lifting**) in writing a script that will set up a new post.

```
$ ./new-post.sh "Post title goes here"
```
